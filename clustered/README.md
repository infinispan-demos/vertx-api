# Clustered Vert.x

## Dummy application

![Clustered Vert.x example](/img/ClusteredVertxApp.png)

#### RandomIdsProducer

Produces randomly [0,1,2] values every 1000 milliseconds and sends them to the event bus "ids" address.

#### RebootConsumer

Consumes the messages from the event bus "ids" address, and launches a "reboot" that lasts for 3000 milliseconds whenever the value is 0. If a reboot is already happening, we donâ€™t need to relaunch any new reboot. When a reboot starts or ends, a message is sent to the event bus to the "reboot" address.


#### Monitoring

Consumes monitoring messages from the event bus "reboot" address and logs them.

## Running the application in cluster mode

* Run RandomIdProducer main `java producer.RandomIdsProducer`
* Run Monitoring main `java cosumer.Monitoring`
* Run RebootConsumer main `java consumer.RebootConsumer`

You can run multiple RebootConsumers, and you will see how using the ClusteredLock, reboots don't overlap.
